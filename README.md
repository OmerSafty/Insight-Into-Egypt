# Insight-Into-Egypt
 Looking at different statistics throughout Egypt's history
## Introduction
I was pretty confused with what project I should do for my first Data Analysis Project. I didn't want a basic database or cliche ones. So I asked myself, what data do you want to see? I remembered how I always hated prejudices about Egypt and Egyptians. So, I wanted to get an insight on Egypt to answer some questions that I wanted to ask:
1. Is Egypt's population rising with the years?
2. Population of the 3 demographic age groups. Did it change with the years?
3. Is the female Employment overwhelming the employment scene?
4. How have different employment fields done through the years?
5. Did Egyptians leave the rural areas to live in urban cities?
6. Generally, what are the top 10 change percentages through the years (Either Positive or Negative)?
