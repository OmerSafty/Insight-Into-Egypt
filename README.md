# Insight-Into-Egypt
 Looking at different statistics throughout Egypt's history
## Introduction
I was confused about what project I should do for my first Data Analysis Project. I didn't want a basic database or cliche ones. So I asked myself, what data do you want to do an insight on? I remembered how I always hated prejudices about Egypt and Egyptians. So, I wanted to get an insight on Egypt to answer some questions that I wanted to ask:
1. Has Egyptâ€™s population growth only surged in recent years, or has it been steadily increasing over time?
2. How has the Population of the 3 demographic age groups changed over the years?
3. Did female Employment affect the total employment scene?
4. How have employment trends evolved across different sectors like agriculture, services, and industry?
5. Has there been a noticeable migration from rural areas to urban cities in Egypt over the years?
6. How did Egypt's energy sources change over the year?
